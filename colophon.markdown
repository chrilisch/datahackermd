I'm Akshay Shah, and you've landed on my little patch of the web--mazel
tov! As a brief introduction, I live in San Francisco, CA, where I'm a data
scientist at [Hearsay Social][]. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can
send me an [email][]; I'm also on [Twitter][], [LinkedIn][], and [GitHub][].

The first thing you'll notice is that I'm the kind of person who calls this
page the colophon. What can I say? "About Me," "Meet Akshay," and "The Happy
Homepage for Rainbow Ponies" are just *so* pedestrian. I like
semicolons, parenthetical asides, fountain pens, and suede elbow patches, too.
Look on the bright side: despite eight years of prep school and Ivy League
education, I still don't own a single pair of Madras shorts.

I'm easily excited--show me something intriguing, and I'll happily spend
weeks reading and experimenting. In the past, I've made fountain pen nibs and
medieval iron-gall ink, roasted coffee beans at home and opened a small
espresso shop, led a cross-country bicycle trip, and mistakenly concocted an
underwater blasting compound. Thus far, all lost fingertips have been
successfully reattached.

Professionally, I've been a public school teacher, an <abbr>EMT</abbr>, and a
medical student. After finishing medical school in 2011, I moved to California
and decided to pursue a career in data science. If you're interested, stay
tuned for a post about leaving medicine for Silicon Valley.

Like the best software, this blog scratches a personal itch: I tend to scribble
notes while I'm thinking, but I miss longer-form writing. If my notes can be
polished into posts that other people find useful or entertaining, then I'll be
thrilled; if not, I'll enjoy the process anyways. Plus, setting up this site
was a [fun technical project][setup].
