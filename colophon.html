    <p>I'm Akshay Shah, and you've landed on my little patch of the web &mdash; mazel tov! As a brief introduction, I live in San Francisco, CA, where I'm a data scientist at <a href="http://hearsaysocial.com">Hearsay Social</a>. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can send me an <a href="mailto:akshay@datahackermd.com">email</a>; I'm also on <a href="http://twitter.com/akshayshah" class="twitter-link">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/akshayjshah">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/akshayjshah">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>The first thing you'll notice is that I'm the kind of person who calls this page the colophon. What can I say? "About Me," "Meet Akshay," and "The Happy Homepage for Rainbow Ponies" are just <em>so</em> pedestrian. I like semicolons, parenthetical asides, fountain pens, and suede elbow patches, too. Look on the bright side: despite eight years of prep school and Ivy League education, I still don't own a single pair of Madras shorts.</p>

    <p>I'm easily excited &mdash; show me something intriguing, and I'll happily spend weeks reading and experimenting. In the past, I've made fountain pen nibs and medieval iron-gall ink, roasted coffee beans at home and opened a small espresso shop, led a cross-country bicycle trip, and mistakenly concocted an underwater blasting compound. Thus far, all lost fingertips have been successfully reattached.</p>

    <p>Professionally, I've been a public school teacher, an <abbr class="initialism">EMT</abbr>, and a medical student. After finishing medical school in 2011, I moved to California and decided to pursue a career in data science. If you're interested, stay tuned for a post about leaving medicine for Silicon Valley.</p>

    <p>Like the best software, this blog scratches a personal itch: I tend to scribble notes while I'm thinking, but I miss longer-form writing. If my notes can be polished into posts that other people find useful or entertaining, then I'll be thrilled; if not, I'll enjoy the process anyways. Plus, setting up this site was a <a href="/posts/2012/hakyll-and-bootstrap.html">fun technical project</a>.
